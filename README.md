## PROJECT OVERVIEW
The project is aimed to help the company's credit card fraud identification system. The mission is to build a fraud detection model using the dataset given.

this project showcase strenght in class balancing and neural networks.


This project involves:

 - Statistical analysis
 - Exploratory data analytics: Data Interactions, and Data Visualizations
 - optimizing class balancing: UnderSampling, Oversampling, SMOTE, and Esemble Sampling method.
 - Artificial Neural network(ANN) architecture: Tensorflow, Loss function, etc.
 - Evaluation metrics: Recall, Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, and AUPRC(Area Under Precision Recall Curve)
 -  and Model devlopment: Random Forest Classifier, and Neural Networks.
